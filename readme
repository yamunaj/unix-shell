	2. setup.c
	3. history.c

.h Files :

	2. history.h
	3. var.h

Other files:
	
	1. Makefile
	2. readme file
	3. readme_old file

Compiling:
	
	The Makefile contains the commands for compiling the source files.
	To compile enter the following command.

	$ make
	
	This will create shell.o, setup.o, history.o and an executable file shell_yj

Clean: 

	To clean enter the following command.

	$ make clean

	This will remove the obj files and the executable file shell_yj

Execute:

	To execute enter the following
	
	$ ./shell_yj


Cases Handled :

Case 1:	Command -> ls | grep test
	Command -> ls|grep test
	
	Ouptut of ls is fed to pipe instead of stdout and input to grep is taken from pipe instead of stdin.
	Output of grep test is printed.

Case 2:	Command -> ls > check.txt
	Command -> ls>check.txt
	
	Output of ls is fed to file check.txt instead of stdout.

Case 3: Command -> ls | grep test > check.txt
	Command -> ls|grep test>check.txt

	Same as Case 1 except that output of grep is fed to file check.txt instead of stdout.

Case 4: Command -> ls > out\>out
	Command -> ls>out\>out
	
	Output of ls is fed to file out>out.

Case 5:	Command -> grep test < in\<in
	Command -> grep test<in\<in
	
	Input to grep test is taken from file in<in.

Case 6:	Command -> ls|grep test|grep i -i|grep n -i|wc
	Command -> ls | grep test | grep i -i | grep n -i | wc

	Output of wc is printed. The will handle upto 5 pipes(i.e., 6 commands)

Case 7: Command -> ls|grep test|grep i -i|grep n -i|wc>output.txt
	Command -> ls | grep test | grep i -i | grep n -i | wc > output.txt

	Output of wc is put n file output.txt.	

Case 8: Command -> ls > out\|put.txt
	Command -> ls>out\|put.txt

	Output of ls is fed to file out|put.

Case 9: Command -> grep test < out\|put.txt | grep i -i | wc > out\&put.txt
	Command -> grep test<out\|put.txt|grep i -i|wc>out\&put.txt

	Input of grep test is taken from file out|put.txt and output of command wc is fed to file out&put.txt.

Note : Refer readme_old file for the cases handled in previous version (not including pipes and file re-direction).
